# flock
Flock an amalgamation of Flow and Fork, is a Systems programming language, designed to be easy to read, easy to write, and performant.

## Flock's initial aims:

* No Garbage collector, With support for object graphs (over object trees) inspired by rust
* Flow executions, i.e. Parallelisation without Threads. inspired by projectreactor.io
* A clear distinction between what I am (Structs) and what I do (Traits)
* Object Orientated
* Functional
* Strongly Typed
* Symbol minimalist (i.e. keeping down on the number of different symbols)
* Clearly Structured, (i.e. not perl)
* Pointer free (no ``&**``mayvar)
* Convention orientated, (i.e. if most programming languages have a convention, follow that convention)
* Operator overloading, whilst retaining clarity (tough one)
* no lifetime semantics,
* Machine sympathetic, (Smart resource management)
* Fully compiled
* Support for Dependency Injection
* Support for Aspect Orientated Programming
* Support for Testing (including spec by example, such as cucumber)
* Null free
* Extensible
